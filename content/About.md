# About me

With 2 years experience in designing, building, testing and supporting web applications(mainly Java), I have extensive experience of Java (Core), Java web development, Java/J2EE, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, and database systems. In my working experience, I played an important role in building a data streaming platform to support one of the leading automotive business, mainly based on kafka stream technology. I also actively participated and contributed in the process migrating a PaaS environment from a monolith application to microservices architecture. Specifically, I developed backend components and conducted unit testing for Template API services(Spring boot) and Message Trigger Services(Node.js), and initiated template migration project to migrate legacy data to adapt to the new services. Through playing roles in developing those projects I am confident that my skills can smoothly fit in roles requiring modern development methodologies and technologies.
